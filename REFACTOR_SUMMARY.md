# WeChat Keyboard Switch - Refactoring Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the comprehensive refactoring of the WeChatKeyboardSwitch tweak to improve reliability, stability, and performance for iOS 16+ with rootless support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Code Architecture
**Before:** Monolithic approach with inline logic in hooks
**After:** Modular architecture with dedicated helper classes

#### New Helper Classes:
- **PrefsManager**: Centralized preference management with reload capability
- **KeyboardSurfaceFinder**: Smart keyboard surface detection with fallback strategy
- **ModeSwitcher**: Deterministic input mode switching with verification
- **GestureManager**: Comprehensive gesture handling with debouncing (singleton pattern)

### 2. Gesture Handling Improvements

#### Robust Surface Detection
- Primary: Search for UIRemoteKeyboardWindow and its descendants
- Target: UIInputSetHostView or UIKBKeyplaneView (optimal for iOS 16+)
- Fallback: UIKeyboardImpl if remote keyboard window not found
- Recursive view hierarchy search

#### Multiple Gesture Recognizers
- **UISwipeGestureRecognizer** (up/down): Primary gesture method
- **UIPanGestureRecognizer**: Fallback with thresholds:
  - Minimum vertical movement: 50 points
  - Minimum velocity: 200 points/sec
  - Requires more vertical than horizontal movement

#### Gesture Configuration
- `cancelsTouchesInView = NO`: Prevents interference with normal typing
- `delaysTouchesBegan = NO`: Immediate response
- `delaysTouchesEnded = NO`: No artificial delays

#### Debouncing
- 250ms interval between gestures
- Prevents double triggers from rapid swipes
- Timestamp-based implementation

#### Hardware Keyboard Detection
- Checks `isInHardwareKeyboardMode` on UIKeyboardImpl
- Automatically disables gestures when external keyboard connected
- Prevents conflicts with hardware keyboard shortcuts

### 3. WeChat IME Detection

#### Enhanced Detection Logic
- Checks current input mode identifier via UIKeyboardInputModeController
- Patterns matched:
  - `com.tencent.xin`
  - `com.tencent.wechat`
  - `WeChat`
  - `Weixin`

#### Verification Before Action
- All gestures verify WeChat keyboard is active
- No action taken if different keyboard is active
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### 4. Deterministic Mode Switching

#### Smart Mode Discovery
- Scans all active input modes
- Categorizes modes:
  - WeChat Chinese (zh-Hans, zh-Hant, Pinyin, 拼音)
  - WeChat English (en, en_US, en-US, English)
  - System Chinese (fallback)
  - System English (fallback)

#### Priority Order
1. WeChat-specific modes (preferred)
2. System modes (fallback)

#### Switch Verification
- Checks mode after switch (100ms delay)
- Automatic retry if switch failed
- Redundant setting on both UIKeyboardInputModeController and UIKeyboardImpl
- Debug logging for troubleshooting

### 5. Safety & Resilience

#### Private API Safety
- All selectors checked with `respondsToSelector:` before use
- No assumptions about API availability
- Graceful degradation if APIs unavailable

#### Memory Management
- Weak reference to keyboard surface (prevents retain cycles)
- Proper cleanup in dealloc
- Strong references only for gesture recognizers (owned by GestureManager)

#### Thread Safety
- All UI operations dispatched on main queue
- GCD async for mode switching
- GCD async with delay for verification

#### Exception Handling
- @try/@catch around mode switching logic
- Prevents crashes from unexpected API behavior
- Errors logged for debugging

### 6. Debug Logging

#### Compile-Time Control
- `DEBUG` flag enables logging
- `DLog` macro expands to NSLog in debug builds
- Completely compiled out in release builds (zero overhead)

#### Comprehensive Logging Points
- Initialization
- Preference changes
- Gesture detection and processing
- Mode switching attempts
- Verification results
- Surface finding
- Errors and exceptions

### 7. Preferences Integration

#### Real-Time Updates
- Darwin notification observer
- Immediate enable/disable without respring
- Gesture attachment/removal on toggle

#### Rootless Path
- `/var/jb/var/mobile/Library/Preferences/com.yourrepo.wechatkeyboardswitch.plist`
- Compatible with rootless jailbreaks (Dopamine, Palera1n)

### 8. Hook Strategy

#### UIKeyboardImpl Hook
- Hooks `setDelegate:` method
- Triggers gesture attachment when keyboard becomes active
- Ensures gestures added at appropriate time

#### UIRemoteKeyboardWindow Hook
- Hooks `didMoveToWindow` method
- Additional attachment point for iOS 16+ keyboard window
- Ensures coverage across different keyboard presentation scenarios

## Files Modified

- **Lines**: 195 → 596 (3x increase for better organization)
- **Classes**: 4 new helper classes
- **Functions**: Modular static methods
- **Hooks**: 2 strategic hooks

## Testing Recommendations

### Build Tests
- [ ] Clean build succeeds: `make clean && make package`
- [ ] Debug build succeeds: `make clean && make DEBUG=1 package`
- [ ] Package structure valid: `dpkg -c packages/*.deb`

### Runtime Tests (On Device)
- [ ] Install and respring successful
- [ ] Settings entry appears
- [ ] Toggle switch works
- [ ] Swipe up → English (when WeChat keyboard active)
- [ ] Swipe down → Chinese (when WeChat keyboard active)
- [ ] No response when different keyboard active
- [ ] Normal typing unaffected
- [ ] Scrolling in apps unaffected
- [ ] No crashes in SpringBoard
- [ ] No crashes in WeChat app
- [ ] No crashes in other apps
- [ ] Toggle disable stops gestures immediately
- [ ] Toggle enable resumes gestures immediately
- [ ] Hardware keyboard disables gestures
- [ ] Rapid swipes don't cause issues (debounced)

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Keyboard appears/disappears repeatedly
- [ ] Switching between apps
- [ ] Multitasking gestures
- [ ] Rotation changes
- [ ] Split screen / slide over
- [ ] Low memory situations

## Performance Considerations

### Minimal Overhead
- Debug logging compiled out in release builds
- Gesture recognizers only added when enabled
- Weak references prevent memory leaks
- Single singleton GestureManager instance
- Efficient string matching (containsString)

### Optimization Opportunities (Future)
- Cache keyboard surface between gestures
- Limit gesture attachment frequency
- Batch mode scanning
- Profile memory usage

## Known Limitations

1. **WeChat Keyboard Required**: Only works when WeChat/Weixin keyboard is active
2. **Mode Variants Required**: Both Chinese and English variants must be enabled
3. **Third-Party Managers**: May conflict with other keyboard management tweaks
4. **API Dependency**: Relies on private iOS keyboard APIs (may change in future iOS versions)

## Upgrade Path

Users upgrading from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0:
1. No configuration changes required
2. Preferences preserved
3. May notice improved reliability
4. May notice gestures feel more responsive
5. Toggle now works without respring

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- [ ] Per-app whitelist/blacklist
- [ ] Configurable debounce interval
- [ ] Haptic feedback on successful switch
- [ ] Visual indicator for current mode
- [ ] Support for more IME types
- [ ] Gesture customization (3-finger swipe, etc.)
- [ ] Landscape orientation optimization
- [ ] iPad-specific enhancements

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the reliability, maintainability, and user experience of the WeChatKeyboardSwitch tweak. The modular architecture makes future enhancements easier, while the comprehensive safety checks ensure stability across different iOS versions and scenarios.
