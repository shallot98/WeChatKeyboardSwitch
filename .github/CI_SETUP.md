# CI/CD Setup Summary

## What Has Been Added

This document summarizes the GitHub Actions CI/CD setup for the WeChatIMEGestureSwitch project.

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/build.yml`
Main GitHub Actions workflow file that automates the build process for rootless iOS 16 builds.

**Key Features:**
- Automated builds on push/PR to main branches
- Manual workflow dispatch trigger
- Automatic release creation on version tags
- iOS 16 SDK support
- Rootless jailbreak package generation
- Artifact upload for easy download

### 2. `.github/workflows/README.md`
Comprehensive documentation for the CI/CD workflow.

**Contents:**
- Workflow triggers and configuration
- Build process explanation
- Rootless and iOS 16 compatibility details
- Usage instructions
- Troubleshooting guide
- Installation instructions for built packages

## Quick Start

### Triggering a Build

**Automatic:**
```bash
git push origin main
```

**Manual:**
1. Go to Actions tab on GitHub
2. Select "Build Rootless iOS 16 Tweak"
3. Click "Run workflow"

**Release:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0
```

### Downloading Built Package

1. Navigate to Actions tab
2. Click on the workflow run
3. Download artifact under "Artifacts" section
4. Transfer `.deb` to device and install

## Build Configuration

The workflow uses existing project configuration:

**From Makefile:**
```makefile
TARGET := iphone:clang:latest:16.0
ARCHS = arm64 arm64e
THEOS_PACKAGE_SCHEME = rootless
```

**Build Steps:**
1. Setup Ubuntu runner
2. Install build dependencies
3. Clone Theos
4. Download iOS 16 SDK
5. Build with `make package FINALPACKAGE=1`
6. Upload `.deb` as artifact

## Compatibility

- ✅ iOS 16.0+
- ✅ Rootless jailbreak (palera1n, Dopamine, XinaA15)
- ✅ arm64 and arm64e architectures
- ✅ Compatible with Sileo, Zebra package managers

## Integration

The main README.md has been updated to include:
- Reference to CI/CD automated builds
- Instructions for downloading pre-built packages
- Link to workflow documentation

## Testing the Workflow

To test the workflow:

1. Push this branch to GitHub
2. Navigate to Actions tab
3. Verify workflow triggers automatically
4. Check build logs for any errors
5. Download and test the generated `.deb` package

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
- Add code signing
- Multi-version SDK support
- Parallel builds for different iOS versions
- Integration tests
- Automatic deployment to repository

## Support

For issues with the CI/CD workflow:
- Check `.github/workflows/README.md` for troubleshooting
- Review build logs in Actions tab
- Verify Makefile configuration
- Ensure all dependencies are listed in control file
